<h1> Ergollamas-Alphpacas Utilties and Project </h1>

<h2> Utilties: </h2>
<b> Discord Bot </b> ~ <i> commands and db for the official server / verifies tokens </i> <br>
<b> Game (in Progress) </b> ~ <i> basic framework </i> <br>
<b> Journey </b> ~ <i> an alephium/ergo token verification tool </i> <br>
<br>
<b> * ALL UTILITIES are OPEN SOURCE * </b>
<br>
<h2> Ergollama's: </h2>
<p> Ergollamas can be found on the <a href="https://ergoplatform.org/en/"> Ergo Blockchain </a>. There exists a finite 128 llamas that contain hand drawn traits and are hand assembled and minted. Ergollama's and Alphpaca's share the same utilties and holders of either can look forward to seeing each other in game. While the flagship of this project might remain Alphpaca's due to Alephium's undeveloped Ecosystem we hope to make it so one day if you'd like; that we can bridge the two back and forth. </p>
<br>
<h2> Alphpaca's: </h2>
<p> Alphpaca's is the flagship NFT collection of the <a href="https://alephium.org/"> Alephium Blockchain </a>. These are currently still in the art development phase. </p>
